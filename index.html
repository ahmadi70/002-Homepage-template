                                        Loraine Rickard-Martin delivers the evolving CCSI curriculum to enhance international sanctions practices and implementation skills to diplomatic and government officials, through co-managing sanctions reform processes such as the High Level Review of UN Sanctions (2015) and the follow-on Assessment of the HLR (2017) and co-implementing the Best Practices Guide for Chairs and Members of UN Sanctions Committees (2018 and 2020). Prior to co-founding CCSI in 2011, she served the United Nations for over three decades, including 15 years as senior political affairs officer and sanctions committee secretary in the Security Council Affairs Division of the Department of Political Affairs, New York, advising sanctions committee chairs and members, supporting teams of sanctions monitors, and participating in reform processes to refine the sanctions tool. She was secretary of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (2003-2004). She advised the African Union’s Peace and Security Council on sanctions issues with the drafting of an AU sanctions manual (2012). She lectured on United Nations sanctions at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and taught an intensive ten-week course for diplomats at Columbia University (2010-2013).  She is the co-author with Enrico Carisch and Shawna Meister of “The Evolution of UN Sanctions: From a Tool of Warfare to a Tool of Peace, Security and Human Rights (2017), and  has co-authored other articles and publications on international sanctions.

                                      <p>Fereshteh Forough was born a refugee in Iran after her family fled Afghanistan because of the Soviet invasion. Despite the family’s circumstances, her parents instilled in her and her siblings the value of education from an early age. Her mother sewed clothing to sell in order to earn money to buy school supplies for the children. When she was a teen, the Taliban regime collapsed and she and her family moved back to Herat, Afghanistan. After returning to Herat, she earned her Bachelor’s in Computer Science. She later earned her Master’s from Technical University of Berlin in Germany. She returned to Herat University to join the Computer Science faculty, where she taught for almost three years. In 2015, she established Code to Inspire, the first computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan. Leading all aspects of operations and fundraising remotely, CTI educated more than 250 students so far in coding and graphic design classes. Ms. Forough remains focused on a vision of a future for her homeland where young women play a prominent role in the economy and future success.</p>

                                      <p>Code to Inspire (CTI) is the first computer coding school for girls in Afghanistan founded in January 2015 by former refugee and computer science professor Fereshteh Forough. CTI empowers women in Afghanistan to drive economic and social progress by teaching them how to code, helping them find jobs, create startup ventures, build digital careers and achieve economic independence.</p>
                                      <p>Code to Inspire addresses poverty, cultural and patriarchal barriers, freedom of movement and economic challenges that women in Afghanistan face by providing a free one year after school program in a safe environment for women aged 18-25. By teaching them coding and other complementary skills, such as graphic design, they begin a path towards financial independence and help narrow the economic and educational gender gap in Afghanistan.  </p>

                                      <p>There was something I could never imagine – getting a job from my technical skills. Lack of opportunities for women in my city and Afghanistan is a big pushback for women to join the tech sector. </p>
                                      <p>When I enrolled at CTI to become a mobile application developer, I was excited to be in a safe place where I can express myself without being criticized and always encouraged. </p>
                                      <p>I was able to develop a mobile app for the Afghanistan Traffic department. Many people downloaded the app and provided insightful feedback and also encouraged me to make more apps.</p>
                                      <p>After I grated from CTI, with their support I got introduced to a startup in the US to help them with their upcoming mobile project. It is my first paid job and I am so proud of myself to be on the path of financial independence and supporting my family. </br>
                                      CTI is my home and I am so grateful for their support.

                                      <p>Farahnaz Osmani is one of our top graduates from Graphic Design class. Her dedication, creativity and hard work inspired us to hire her as Code to Inspire graphic design mentor and set an example to the other students to be a role model.</p>
                                      <p>Farahnaz says: “Since I was a child I had a deep interest in art and creativity. 
                                      When I just enrolled in the university, I learned about CTI and its graphic design class.
                                      During my studies at CTI I found it as an ideal place for any female student who wants to grow without hesitation and fear.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>CTI provided any resources in their capacity to improve our skills. When I asked for a digital pen to do a digital art project, without hesitation school management provided me one. I managed to deliver several paid outsourcing projects for the first time in my life for clients in the US, Europe and Afghanistan.</p>

                                      <p>Arezo Akrami knew very little about computers when she learned about Code to Inspire. The daughter of merchants and one of five children living in Afghanistan, the high school student enrolled in CTI’s Web Development/Web Design class and fell in love with programming and CTI’s safe and welcoming environment. Two years later, she graduated from the CTI program and launched a freelance web development business. The early days were tough, but Arzo landed a project to create a website for a nonprofit organization in Herat. The organization loved her work and hired her as an employee to provide web development services. </p>
                                      <p>“The first ever salary I received through my coding skills was an unforgettable feeling. I was jumping around and wanted to fly,” Arzo said. “I am so happy that I can make money by myself and I am so grateful to CTI for helping to make this happen.”</p>

                                    <p>Mr. Starr served as Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security at the U.S. Department of State, in Washington DC under the Obama administration, and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary under the George W. Bush administration. Ranked as Minister Counselor in the Senior Foreign Service, he was in charge if ensuring a safe and secure environment for the conduct of U.S. foreign policy throughout the world. Mr. Starr was also the United Nations Under Secretary General for Safety and Security, in charge of managing security for all global security operations of the UN. His service with the UN came at a critical juncture when the implementation of the Capital Master Plan required the renovation of UN Headquarters and the temporary dislocation of thousands of UN officials. Previously, he served in various senior management positions as a Special Agent for the US Department of State, including in Tel Aviv, Israel; Tunis, Tunisia; Dakar, Senegal; and Kinshasa, DRC.</p>
